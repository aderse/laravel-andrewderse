# Welcome To My Website
This website was made with Laravel. Nothing fancy, just a simple site that's a copy of https://andrewderse.com/

Yes, I do recognize this is absolute overkill for a static website, but I just wanted to showcase that I knew the gist of Laravel.

## Hosting
This website is not published anywhere. It's a simple copy as mentioned above.

## Running
Basic Laravel with Sail commands apply here.

- composer install
- sail up
